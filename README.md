We're excited to announce the launch of a brand new Discord server dedicated to fostering a vibrant and supportive community for avians, wingkins, angelkins, and anyone currently on the incredible journey of growing wings through subliminals. Created and worked on by people who are on their journey of growing wings of their own via subliminals. We understand that these experiences can be unique and sometimes isolating, and our goal is to provide a safe, inclusive space where you can connect with others who truly understand.

Whether you're looking to share your experiences, seek advice, discuss identity, explore lore, or simply find a friendly place to belong, our server is system friendly/plural friendly we support all system origins and do not allow discrimination. Come join our growing flock, participate in engaging conversations, and build lasting connections with like-minded individuals from around the globe. We believe in mutual respect and creating an environment where everyone feels valued.
