We're excited to announce the launch of a brand new Discord server dedicated to fostering a vibrant and supportive community for avians, wingkins, angelkins, and anyone currently on the incredible journey of growing wings through subliminals. Created and worked on by people who are on their journey of growing wings of their own via subliminals. We understand that these experiences can be unique and sometimes isolating, and our goal is to provide a safe, inclusive space where you can connect with others who truly understand.

Whether you're looking to share your experiences, seek advice, discuss identity, explore lore, or simply find a friendly place to belong, our server is system friendly/plural friendly we support all system origins and do not allow discrimination. Come join our growing flock, participate in engaging conversations, and build lasting connections with like-minded individuals from around the globe. We believe in mutual respect and creating an environment where everyone feels valued.


Thank you for taking the time to learn about our new Discord server. We're dedicated to fostering a respectful and engaging environment for all avians, wingkins, angelkins, and those on the path of growing wings. We can't wait to connect with you and share in this incredible journey!

  Orphic Ashes is a group founded on the middle ground - Characterized by the Phoenix, Orphic Ashes is founded on beliefs of balance, prosperity, and wisdom. We approach nonhumanism not via both extremes in the community (genetics vs subliminal debate), but by the middle ground. Naturally, we do not entertain fakes, but we will not discount other's experiences just because they clash with our own.
